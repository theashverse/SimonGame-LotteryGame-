# 🎮 Two Mini Games: Lottery & Simon Game

This repository contains two browser-based mini-games I built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** back in **January** as part of my frontend development practice.

## 🧩 Project Overview

These games were designed to improve my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, timers, and basic game logic — all using **Vanilla JavaScript** with no external libraries or frameworks.
